Welcome to the **AlgorithmInJava** repository! 🚀 This repository contains a collection of well-structured and tested algorithms implemented in **Java**. It includes various techniques for manipulating arrays, performing mathematical operations, and solving algorithmic problems.

Whether you're a beginner or an advanced Java programmer, this repository will help you enhance your algorithmic skills and improve your problem-solving abilities.

## 📚 Features

This repository provides solutions to common algorithmic problems, focusing on arrays and their manipulation. Each algorithm is implemented with simplicity and clarity, and the methods are tested using **JUnit 5** for correctness.

Some of the key areas covered are:

- Array traversal and manipulation
- Mathematical operations on arrays
- Searching, sorting, and finding specific elements
- Cumulative operations and transformations
- Frequency analysis and prime checking
- Handling negative numbers and replacements
- Reversals and swaps

## 🛠 Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RaminGahramanzada/AlgorithmInJava.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd AlgorithmInJava
   ```

3. **Build the project** with Maven or Gradle:
   
   - For **Maven**:
     ```bash
     mvn install
     ```

   - For **Gradle**:
     ```bash
     gradle build
     ```

4. **Run the tests** using your preferred IDE or the command line:

   - For **Maven**:
     ```bash
     mvn test
     ```

   - For **Gradle**:
     ```bash
     gradle test
     ```

   All the methods in this repository are tested using **JUnit 5**. Each test corresponds to a method in the `LinearTraversal` class or other related algorithm classes. You can find the test cases in the corresponding test files under the `/src/test/java` folder.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

Once you’ve set up the repository and built the project, you can run the tests to validate the functionality of various algorithms. Each method is tested with multiple test cases to ensure it performs as expected under different scenarios.

- To test the methods, simply call the corresponding test class methods from `src/test/java` or run all tests at once to validate the entire suite.

## ✨ Benefits

- **Easy-to-understand** algorithms written in **Java**.
- **JUnit tests** ensure the correctness of each algorithm.
- Clean and well-documented code to help you learn Java algorithms effectively.
- Perfect for students, developers, and coding enthusiasts who want to practice and improve their algorithmic thinking.
